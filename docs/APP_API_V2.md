# AstrBot Phone Agent App API v2

This document describes the app-facing dashboard routes. The command envelope
sent to Android remains schema version 1 and is unchanged.

The routes are registered below the plugin prefix
`/astrbot_plugin_phone_agent`. AstrBot's dashboard authentication protects the
routes; write routes additionally reject a different `Origin`. They do not
perform an Android health probe unless explicitly requested by a device route.

## State

`GET /app/state` returns immediately from plugin memory and disk:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "api_version": 2,
  "server_time": 1760000000.123,
  "backend": "app",
  "features": {"reminders": true, "audit": true},
  "reminders": [{"id":"app-...","text":"喝水","due":1760000060,"source":"app","status":"pending"}],
  "recent_commands": [],
  "timeline": [{"id":"tl-...","type":"reminder","title":"提醒","body":"喝水","related_task_id":null,"timestamp":1760000000.123,"event":"reminder_due","notify":true,"notification_id":"reminder-app-...","reminder_id":"app-..."}]
}
```

`timeline` contains the latest 100 events. `notify` is true only for a
reminder due event. The app polls this list and deduplicates by
`notification_id`; the plugin does not push an app reminder directly.

## App reminders

`POST /app/reminders` accepts exactly the following useful fields:

```json
{"text":"喝水","minutes":15,"request_id":"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"}
```

`minutes` is an integer from 1 through 10080. `request_id` is a UUID and is
idempotent. Repeating it with the same text and duration returns the original
reminder; changing either field returns HTTP 409. NaN, Infinity, invalid JSON,
booleans, fractional numbers and invalid parameter values are rejected. Unknown fields are ignored.

The response is `{ "success": true, "reminder": { ... } }`, where the reminder
has `id`, `text`, `due`, `source: "app"`, and `status: "pending"`.

`POST /app/reminders/cancel` accepts `{"reminder_id":"app-..."}` and returns
`status: "cancelled"`. A reminder already fired, expired, or cancelled returns
`status: "already_finished"` so cancellation is safe to retry.

App reminders are stored with an empty chat session. On due, the plugin first
atomically persists a timeline event, then removes the pending reminder. Recent
overdue reminders are recovered after a restart; reminders older than 24 hours
produce a non-notifying `reminder_expired` event. Chat-created reminders keep
their old QQ delivery and also write the timeline event.

## Direct transport

`app_direct_urls` is a comma-separated ordered list. Configured URLs are tried
before URLs announced by app registration, so an old Tailscale-only registration
cannot displace the preferred LAN URL. Each candidate gets a three-second
health probe and shares one command timeout budget. A result must match
`type=result`, schema version, command ID and action. The `output` field may be
a JSON encoded string; when it contains an object or array it is decoded before
being returned to tools. A matching `success:false` result is final and is not
replayed through another endpoint or relay. Only transport failures try the
next URL or relay, reusing the same command ID.
